# Code against Climate Change
🔥🌏 **Code against Climate Change** is a curated list of tech projects against climate change - hoping to inspire disruptive technological climate action!

**Climate change is the biggest threat of our generation.** Emissions are rising and according to the newest [IPCC report](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/), we are heading towards an [unprecedented disaster](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-report-half-degree.html).
[Political outrage](https://rebellion.earth/) is slowly forming but we also need *technological disruptions*! This living list aims to *educate* hackers and developers on promising tech projects against climate change, *hoping to inspire immediate and disruptive technological climate action!*
